# VIONYX
A modern JavaScript-based banking app that lets users manage accounts, transfer funds, and track transactions in real time.

🌌 Vionyx is a clean, interactive banking app built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 — no frameworks, just pure frontend magic. 💻 It lets users securely log in 🔐 with a simple username and PIN, view a clear and detailed transaction history 📊 with friendly date formatting, and handle everyday banking tasks like transferring money 💸, requesting loans 🏦, or even closing their account ❌.

The interface updates in real time, showing the latest balances, summaries, and includes an auto logout timer ⏱️ to keep things secure. To top it off, Vionyx features a beautiful, animated starry background 🌠 powered by the Canvas API, making the whole experience feel smooth and modern.

Whether you're learning DOM manipulation, event handling, or just building cool stuff — Vionyx is a fun and functional project 🚀 that proves you can do a lot with just the basics 🚫📦.
